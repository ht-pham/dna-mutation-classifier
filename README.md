# DNA Mutation Pathogenicity Classifier


## üîç Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a DNA mutation is benign or pathogenic based on sequence and/or genomic features.

## What is the DNA mutation?
DNA mutations are changes in one or more nucleotide of a DNA sequence. Some are harmless, while others lead to disease. The goal is to predict whether the change is benign or harmful.
Key concepts:
* Reference sequence: normal DNA
* Alternate sequence: mutated DNA
* Variant Consequences: synonymous, missense, nonsense
* Pathogenicity: disease-causing or not
